1.What is the advantage of cross-sectional sample preparation over conventional TEM sample preparation?<br>
<b>a.	Cross-sectional TEM sample preparation process makes available larger region of interest available for imaging.</b><br> 
b.	Cross-sectional TEM sample preparation process makes usage of higher kV for imaging and can provide higher resolution.<br>
c.	Cross-sectional TEM sample preparation process requires lesser number of steps.<br>
d.	Cross-sectional TEM sample preparation process is faster as it uses electrochemical etching.<br>

2.Cross-sectional TEM sample preparation is NOT preferred for imaging:<br>
a.	Modified top-surface via chemical treatment<br>
<b>b.	Nano-crystallites in a bulk matrix </b><br>
c.	Interface between coating and substrate<br>
d.	Nano-textured layers during multi-pass rolling of samples.<br>


3.An important precaution to be observed for processing the cross-sectional TEM sample is:<br>
<b>a.	To preserve the sliced pieces in protected atmosphere and avoid their oxidation</b><br>
b.	Carefully slicing the samples to thickness of less than 1 mm<br>
c.	Utilising liquid nitrogen for the dimpling of samples<br>
d.	Preparing the surface for TEM observation using electrochemical etching.<br>

4.What problem may NOT crop up during mounting of the sliced samples for cross-sectional TEM:<br>
a.	Buoyancy effects may lift the samples up during pouring of epoxy/resin<br>
b.	Shifting of samples may occur during <br>
c.	Alignment of interface region may occur during mounting <br>
<b>d.	Ion beam etching will not work on the mounted samples.</b><br>

5.The sectioned samples are kept placed on the mount with the interface region facing:<br>
a.Parallel to top surface<br>
<b>b.Perpendicular to top surface</b><br>
Note: Larger region of interest is exposed for imaging.
